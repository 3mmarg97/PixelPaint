# PixelPaint

It's a simple java drawing project using swing libs only without using any graphic library (It is just a project for univercity so i can't use any library).
You can save the "Image" but it is saved as an editable version (in txt file) so you can't open the "image" from an image viewer . You can open it from the same program only and re edit it.
